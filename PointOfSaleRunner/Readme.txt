Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple Point of Sale system to calculate a final sale total after applying 
line item discounts.

To Run
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program requires 1 input and 2 system files to run.

The input file is requested at runtime and can be located in any accessible 
directory. 

The two system files -- ProductCatalog.json and PromotionCatalog.json -- must 
be located with the EXE. 

Example system files have been included with this program and should adequately 
document the structure. Any JSON parsing errors should be reported to the 
console with line and character numbers.
